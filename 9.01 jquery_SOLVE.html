Try these challenges to practice more things you can do with
jQuery and DOM elements.

#1: listing Your friends with jQuery
(And Making Them Smell!)
Create an array containing the names of a few friends.
Using a for loop, create a p element for each of your friends
and add it to the end of the body element using the jQuery
append method. Use jQuery to change the h1 element so it says
My friends instead of Hello world!. Use the hide method followed
by the fadeIn method to fade in each name as it’s provided.
Now, modify the p elements you created to add the text
smells! after each friend. Hint: If you select the p elements
using $("p"), the append method will apply to all the p elements.

#2: Making a Heading flash
How could you use fadeOut and fadeIn to cause the heading to
flash five times, once a second? How could you do this using
a for loop? Try modifying your loop so it fades out and fades
in over 1 second the first time, over 2 seconds the second time,
over 3 seconds the third time, and so on.

#3: Delaying Animations
The delay method can be used to delay animations. Using
delay, fadeOut, and fadeIn, make an element on your page fade
out and then fade back in again after 5 seconds.

#4: using fadeTo
Try using the fadeTo method. Its first argument is a number
of milliseconds, as in all the other animation methods. Its
second argument is a number between 0 and 1. What happens
when you run the following code?
$("h1").fadeTo(2000, 0.5);
What do you think the second argument means? Try
using different values between 0 and 1 to figure out what
the second argument is used for.
