      "amazing",

    ];

    // Pick a random word
    var word = words[Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length)];

    // Set up the answer array
    var answerArray = [];

 /*   The for loop  creates a looping variable i that starts at 0
and goes up to (but does not include) word.length. Each time around
the loop, we add a new element to answerArray, at answerArray[i].
When the loop finishes, answerArray will be the same length as word.
For example, if word is "monkey" (which has six letters), answerArray
will be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] (six underscores).
Finally, we create the variable remainingLetters and set it to
the length of the secret word. We’ll use this variable to keep track
of how many letters are left to be guessed. Every time the player
guesses a correct letter, this value will be decremented (reduced)
by 1 for each instance of that letter in the word.  */

    // The game loop
    while (remainingLetters > 0) {
      // Show the player their progress
      alert(answerArray.join(" "));

      // Get a guess from the player
      var guess = prompt("Guess a letter, or click Cancel to stop playing.");
      if (guess === null) {
        // Exit the game loop
        break;
      } else if (guess.length !== 1) {
        alert("Please enter a single letter.");
      } else {
        guess = guess.toLowerCase();


/* At u, prompt takes a guess from the player and saves it to the
variable guess. One of four things will happen at this point.
116 Chapter 7
First, if the player clicks the Cancel button, then guess will be
null. We check for this condition at v with if (guess === null). If
this condition is true, we use break to exit the loop.
NoTe
You can use the break keyword in any loop to immediately stop loop-
ing, no matter where the program is in the loop or whether the while
condition is currently true.
The second and third possibilities are that the player enters
either nothing or too many letters. If they enter nothing but click
OK, guess will be the empty string "". In this case, guess.length
will be 0. If they enter anything more than one letter, guess.length
will be greater than 1.
At w, we use else if (guess.length !== 1) to check for these
conditions, ensuring that guess is exactly one letter. If it’s not,
we display an alert saying, “Please enter a single letter.”
The fourth possibility is that the player enters a valid guess of
one letter. Then we have to update the game state with their guess
using the else statement at x, which we’ll do in the next section. */


        // Update the game state with the guess
        for (var j = 0; j < word.length; j++) {
          if (word[j] === guess) {
            answerArray[j] = guess;
            remainingLetters--;
          }
        }
      }
    // The end of the game loop
    }

/* At u, we create a for loop with a new looping variable called j,
which runs from 0 up to word.length. (We’re using j as the variable
in this loop because we already used i in the previous for loop.) We
use this loop to step through each letter of word. For example, let’s
say word is pancake. The first time around this loop, when j is 0,
word[j] will be "p". The next time, word[j] will be "a", then "n", "c",
"a", "k", and finally "e".
At v, we use if (word[j] === guess) to check whether the cur-
rent letter we’re looking at matches the player’s guess. If it does,
we use answerArray[j] = guess to update the answer array with
Creating a Hangman Game 117
the current guess. For each letter in the word that matches guess,
we update the answer array at the corresponding point. This
works because the looping variable j can be used as an index for
answerArray just as it can be used as an index for word */

    // Show the answer and congratulate the player
    alert(answerArray.join(" "));
    alert("Good job! The answer was " + word);
